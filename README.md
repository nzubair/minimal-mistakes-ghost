# Minimal Mistakes for Ghost

Minimal Mistakes (for Ghost) is a port of [Michael Rose's](https://github.com/mmistakes) Jekyll theme, [Minimal Mistake](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) for [Ghost](https://tryghost.org/) platform. 

<aside class="notice">
Please note that this iteration of Minimal Mistakes is based on on [v4.1.1](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/tree/4.1.1) of Minimal Mistakes for Jekyll.

This was a purely selfish decision, as I was looking to replicate my Jekyll theme as is. If time permits, I will bring it up to a more recent version of Minimal Mistakes.
